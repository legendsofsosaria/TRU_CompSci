 * Design and implement a recursive program that uses Euclidâ€™s algorithm to
 * determine the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.
 * A greatest common divisor is the largest integer that divides both numbers
 * without a remainder. For example: for 40 and 24, both 2 and 4 are
 * common divisors, but 8 is the greatest common divisor; for 40 and 10 both 2
 * and 5 are common divisors, but 10 is the greatest common divisor;
 * for 17 and 51 the only common divisor is 17, hence it is the greatest.
 * 
 * Reproduce the three examples given above. Generate 30 sets of random integers
 * between 1 and 100, outputting them and their gcd.
